Slave Crawler : 

How I developed Micro-service that is so light weight and runs on 800 MB RAM : 

•	Avoiding objects – Specially Class Objects – Objects are heavy weight occupying 48 bytes.
•	Use Global Instance Static Classes – that is common and can be shared across instances. 
•	Byte[] and Str[] instead of Strings and Collections.
•	Parallel arrays where – a[key] and a[value] takes less space and more memory efficient than Collections map and List.
•	Map Collections used with final static – with fixed size .
Eg: Map<byte[],Integer> container = new HashMap<byte[],Integer>(1), defines Map of size 1.
•	Creates Arrays of fixed size only on demand , array of byte takes less bytes than String.
•	StringBuilder() instead of String has drastically reduced the memory space. 
•	Use of short instead of int , volatile instead of final .
•	Security – Classes are final as they cannot be extended or override or overloaded.
•	AtomicBoolean , AtomicInteger – Helps maintain dedicated variable in  a multi threaded environment.
•	Singleton Pattern for Thread safe class access. 
•	Static classes and methods stored in Permanent Generation or metaspace as it reduces the GC Pauses.
•	Use of <exclusions> </exclusions> in maven to prevent unused classes to be loaded in JVM Runtime . Please refer to AmazonAurora/pom.xml for the exclusions.
•	-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=80 (in milliseconds)  - This JVM parameter will make your JVM more responsive and highly available for crawling as it reduces the time taken for GC Pauses.
•	Crash Proof – Fault Tolerance – Persisting and saving the serialized file to /home/ec2-user for reloading the fail incase the JVM abruptly shutsdown.

What my Crawler Can do : 
•	Language Detection – English , German , Japanese, … etc. upto 54 languages of home page.
•	Email Address , Phone number and Address Extraction (city, Zipcode and State) . 
•	Stop words removal, Text Normalization and outgoing links extraction. 
•	Outgoing Links – Programmed for 8 links outgoing inner links from the home page to the neighbouring pages (1 hops). 
•	Keyword Analysis of the Body text of a URL HTML page – Key => Words , Value => Counts (frequency of words in a html document). 
•	Duplicate Finder – returns true of it finds duplicates of text across the 9 URLS of a ROOT webpage. MD5 Hash Algorithm is used for cross checking the duplicates. 
•	Link Discover – Automatically Discover Links that has contact us or about us page and extracts the phone number and email address.
•	User Agent Rotator – Rotates the User Agent – with different User Agent Strings.
•	Facebook <og:> open graph tag extractor – title , description ,url etc.

Security Measures: 
•	Rate Limiting – Slave crawler – AmazonAurora (project) , 30 Seconds to crawl the 1 + 8 child URLs. Within which if we try to submit the URLS it doesn’t accept it. Prevention of DDos Attack strategy.
•	No More than 9 HTTP Links can be crawled from the same end server – to be crawler using different user agent strings.
•	CrawlContract.java – has the politeness delay between each request as 1500 milliseconds.
•	Use of final across class which cannot be extended or modified.
•	ThreadSafe Immutability – Atomic Integer , Singleton classes to avoid repeated URL submission errors.



In Local Setup:

Slave Web Crawler – 
•	Git clone https://github.com/krithivasanchandran/amazonaurora.git
•	Mvn clean install
•	In ide – Right Click on AuroraMainApp.java -> Run as Java Application.

Test using this URL : 
http://localhost:8080/startCrawl?url=http://flipkart.com

You should be able to see the logs in the console.
